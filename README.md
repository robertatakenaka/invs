## Startup the development environment and operations

You can use docker commands for the following if you wish, just check our makefile

What about commands in the makefile?

Type inside de project ```make help```:

```bash
    Usage: make [target] [argument] ...

    Argument:
        compose = {compose_file_name}

        targets:

        ps                                 See all containers using $(COMPOSE_FILE_DEV)
        rm                                 Remove all containers using $(COMPOSE_FILE_DEV)

        django_fast                        Run tests fast from django container using $(COMPOSE_FILE_DEV)
        django_makemigrations              Run makemigrations from django container using $(COMPOSE_FILE_DEV)

```

To build the stack for development enviroment you can use the following command:

```bash
    make build compose=local.yml
```

is the same of type:

```bash
    make
```

To run the project type:

```bash
    make up
```

To stop the project type:

```bash
    make stop
```

If you want to build, run, wherever with other params on .yml or from production or duplicate a subfolder in .envs and a subfolder on compose and "listo" you can user the make command with argument compose.

Note that the stack is configured with 2 files docker-compose environment development=local.yml and production=production.yml.

Below are some actions you must follow for properly running applications.

## Settings

Moved to [settings](http://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/settings.html).

## Basic Commands

### Setting Up Your Users

-   To create a **normal user account**, just go to Sign Up and fill out the form. Once you submit it, you'll see a "Verify Your E-mail Address" page. Go to your console to see a simulated email verification message. Copy the link into your browser. Now the user's email should be verified and ready to go.

-   To create a **superuser account**, use this command:

        $ python manage.py createsuperuser

For convenience, you can keep your normal user logged in on Chrome and your superuser logged in on Firefox (or similar), so that you can see how the site behaves for both kinds of users.

### Type checks

Running type checks with mypy:

    $ mypy core

### Test coverage

To run the tests, check your test coverage, and generate an HTML coverage report:

    $ coverage run -m pytest
    $ coverage html
    $ open htmlcov/index.html

#### Running tests with pytest

    $ pytest

### Live reloading and Sass CSS compilation

Moved to [Live reloading and SASS compilation](https://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developing-locally.html#sass-compilation-live-reloading).

### Celery

This app comes with Celery.

To run a celery worker:

``` bash
cd core
celery -A config.celery_app worker -l info
```

Please note: For Celery's import magic to work, it is important *where* the celery commands are run. If you are in the same folder with *manage.py*, you should be right.

### Email Server

In development, it is often nice to be able to see emails that are being sent from your application. For that reason local SMTP server [MailHog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) with a web interface is available as docker container.

Container mailhog will start automatically when you will run all docker containers.
Please check [cookiecutter-django Docker documentation](http://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment-with-docker.html) for more details how to start all containers.

With MailHog running, to view messages that are sent by your application, open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8025`

### Sentry

Sentry is an error logging aggregator service. You can sign up for a free account at <https://sentry.io/signup/?code=cookiecutter> or download and host it yourself.
The system is set up with reasonable defaults, including 404 logging and integration with the WSGI application.

You must set the DSN url in production.

## Deployment

The following details how to deploy this application.

### Docker

See detailed [cookiecutter-django Docker documentation](http://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment-with-docker.html).
